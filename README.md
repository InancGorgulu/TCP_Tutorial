# TCP Server Tutorial - A Beginner's Guide to Winsock Programming

Welcome to the **TCP Server Tutorial** repository! This project serves as an introductory guide to setting up a simple **TCP server** using **Winsock (Windows Sockets API)** in C++. 

## 📌 Overview

This repository provides a step-by-step implementation of a **basic TCP server** that:
- Initializes **Winsock**.
- Creates a **socket** and binds it to an **IP address and port**.
- Listens for incoming connections.
- Accepts a client connection and **receives messages**.
- Sends a **response** back to the client.
- Properly handles **socket errors** and **connection closures**.

The goal of this tutorial is to help beginners understand **network programming** in C++ using **Winsock**.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following:

- **Windows OS** (since Winsock is used)
- **C++ compiler** (MinGW, MSVC, or Clang)
- **Basic understanding of socket programming** (recommended)

## 🛠️ How It Works (Implementation Details)

This project follows these steps:

1. **Initialize Winsock** using `WSAStartup()`.
2. **Create a socket** using `socket()`.
3. **Bind the socket** to an IP address and port using `bind()`.
4. **Listen for incoming connections** using `listen()`.
5. **Accept client connections** using `accept()`.
6. **Receive messages** from clients using `recv()`.
7. **Send responses** using `send()`.
8. **Close connections properly** using `closesocket()`.
9. **Clean up Winsock** using `WSACleanup()`.

## 📝 Notes

- 📌 This project is meant for **educational purposes** and serves as a **basic TCP server**.
- ⚠️ Error handling is included, but it can be **further improved for robustness**.
- 🔄 You can modify this project to **support multiple clients** using **multi-threading** or `select()`.
